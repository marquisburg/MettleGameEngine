# Mettle Game Engine

A Windows game engine and editor written entirely in [Mettle](https://github.com/marquisburg/Mettle) — no C++, no MSVC, no NASM. Mettle source compiles straight to `.exe` via its own internal PE linker, against `vulkan-1.dll`, `lua55.dll`, and Win32.

Pre-alpha. Boots, renders, plays. Sharp edges.

## What's in the box

Three executables built from `[engine/](engine/)`:

- `**engine_editor.exe**` — GDI editor chrome (explorer, inspector, game tree, output log) with a child Vulkan viewport.
- `**engine_play_server.exe**` — headless authoritative server. Runs `ServerScripts` and replicates over TCP.
- `**engine_play_client.exe**` — render client. Connects to the server, runs `ClientScripts`, draws via Vulkan.

Hit **Play** in the editor and it snapshots the scene, writes `.mettleplay/playtest.manifest`, and spawns the two play binaries as real processes. They talk via the wire format in `[engine/engine_play_protocol.mettle](engine/engine_play_protocol.mettle)`. **Stop** kills them and restores the scene.

## Scripting

Lua 5.5. Folder determines role.

```
ServerScripts/   authoritative, server only
ClientScripts/   client only
SharedScripts/   shared via require()
```

Define `function on_tick(dt)` and the runtime calls it each fixed step (1/60s) with `engine.*` in scope (`get_pos`/`set_pos`, `translate`, `rotate_world`, `input_held`/`pressed`/`released`, `log`, `IA.*`). Full surface is at the top of `[engine/engine_lua.mettle](engine/engine_lua.mettle)`.

## Building

Requirements: Windows 10/11 x64, Vulkan SDK (`vulkan-1.dll` on PATH), Lua 5.5 (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Lua` or `LUA_HOME`). The Mettle compiler is checked in at `[bin/mettle.exe](bin/mettle.exe)`.

```powershell
.\build_engine_editor.bat
```

Builds all three binaries and copies `lua55.dll` next to them. Add `--release` for optimized builds, `-s` for symbolized crash tracebacks. Regenerate shaders with `python engine\shaders\regen_spirv.py`.

## Running

```powershell
cd examples
.\engine_editor.exe
```

Opens `[project.mproj](project.mproj)` and loads `[scene.mscene](scene.mscene)` — a few cubes and Artorias' sword. Edit in the viewport, double-click scripts to open the inline Lua editor, hit Play.

## Layout

```
engine/      Engine source (all .mettle)
  shaders/   GLSL + regen_spirv.py
examples/    Editor, play server, play client, sample script folders
bin/         Pre-built mettle.exe, runtime, stdlib
src/         Mettle compiler C source (mirrored)
docs/        Mettle language reference (mirrored)
tests/       Smoke tests
```

## Known limitations

- Windows only, Vulkan only. No abstraction layer to port.
- Renderer is intentionally tiny: one pipeline, per-vertex color, MVP push constant, depth.
- Single playtest client (server accepts one TCP connection).
- Legacy `SCRIPT_SPIN`/`BOB`/`PLAYER` path still ticks alongside Lua; new scenes should be Lua-only.
- No hot-reload for `.mettle` code. Lua reloads on the next tick.
- See `[docs/known-limitations.md](docs/known-limitations.md)` for language-level caveats.
